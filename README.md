# eaglercraft-autoclicker-1.8.8
tampermonkey autoclicker for eaglercraft 1.8.8
this code is stupid bullshit it needs a proper recode but anyways it bypasses like all servers so it's good right (it had a gui before but i fucked it up so it does not anymore lol)
made it only because i did not see any autoclickers made for pvp in tampermonkey like idk why 
# to-do list
- gui (idk)
- make it work when holding lmb
- rework the code
- more cool features
